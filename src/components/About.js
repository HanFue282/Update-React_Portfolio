                <p> My name is Hannah Joy Fuentes. I'm 22 years old, and I am attending SMU Coding Bootcamp. I came to
                    learn more about coding
                    and for my future career in video game development.
                    In the past months, it's been intersting and fun with a slice of struggle. It's a lot of hardwork to
                    get into the program, but they
                    set you with the tools you'll need for your future career. There were a lot of hard times where I
                    scratch my head on for hours, but then soon
                    to realize that it was a misspelling or a missing tag. It's fun learning new things in class, and
                    mistakes along the way.
